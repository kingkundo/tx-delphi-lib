# TX Delphi Library
A custom utilities and UI library built for the Delphi VCL. Feel free to use these units in your code for whatever purpose, so long as you credit me and link to this library somewhere :)

# How to use
Add the directory that you clone this project into to your Delphi IDE's library path. This allows Delphi to find and index the library. A simple google search will send you on your way if you're struggling.

# Containing...
- TX_RetroGrid: The object used to render and control various grid based layouts, primarily aimed at recreating classic video games, along with designing new ones. It is used in the [Game of Life project](https://github.com/tomxxi/game-of-life-delphi).
